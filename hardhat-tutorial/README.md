# Token Project
It is a simple Ethereum smart contract project using Hardhat.

# Process overview
The process includes setting up the development environment, writing 
a simple smart contract, creating tests to ensure the contract behaves 
as expected, and finally deploying the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
